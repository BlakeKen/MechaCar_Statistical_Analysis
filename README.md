# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Linear regression to Predict MPG

* Variables that provided non random amount of variance: vehicle_length, ground_clearance
* Slope of the linear model
  * Not equal to zero
  * p-value is 5.35e-11, smaller than the significance level
* Does it predict the MechaCar protypes effectively? 
  * Yes the R-squared was .7149 which means it does a decent job just not the best
